My research is devoted to the emerging discipline of computational medicine. I try to contribute to the development of quantitative methods for understanding the molecular mechanisms, medical diagnosis, and pharmacological treatment of human disease through applications of mathematics, physics and computational science. My current focus lies on mental disorders (mostly bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) for which I try to develop mathematical and computational models which merge modern genomics and molecular biology with models of psychiatric pathophysiology. 


My background
======
I graduated (Summa Cum Laude) with a degree in Physics and Astronomy from the Vrije Universiteit Brusel in the summer of 2017. There I had specialised in theoretical physics and wrote my thesis on the interplay between quantum many-body physics, quantum information and string theory. After doing further research on this at the University of Ghent, I changed track in 2019 and moved to London where I worked on deep learning for computational drug design. With this professional experience in my backpack, I returned to academia in 2020.
