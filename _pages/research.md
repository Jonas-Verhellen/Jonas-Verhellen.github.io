I am currently doing a PhD as part of the 4MENT convergence environment at the life sciences cluster of the University of Oslo. 


The convergence environment was set up to better understand the etiology and disease mechanisms of severe mental disorders, focusing on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and related mental phenotypes. The main objective is to cross the gap between research teams across several disciplines including molecular and statistical genetics, large-scale data mining/machine learning, mathematical modeling and brain imaging integrated with psychiatry, psychology and philosophy.
