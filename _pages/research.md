MultiModal Mental Models (4MENT)
======

Converging approaches from genomes to mental illness and interplay with psychosocial stressors. The convergence environment [4MENT](https://www.uio.no/english/research/strategic-research-areas/life-science/research/convergence-environments/4ment/) wants to better understand the etiology and disease mechanisms of severe mental disorders, focusing on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and related mental phenotypes. Mental disorders are recognized as leading causes of morbidity globally, and are among the costliest disorders to affect humans. Mental disorders are complex, with biological and psychosocial mechanisms. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to generate new knowledge.

Identifying the underlying pathophysiology is imperative and can lead to major health benefits, through better treatment and prevention strategies. Within 4MENT, I work together with [Gaute T. Einevoll](https://scholar.google.no/citations?user=np0Lz5kAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Tuomo MÃ¤ki-Marttunen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_s1J6DgAAAAJ&hl=en), to apply mathematical models to link risk variants to gene expression, protein levels and electrophysiological functions of neurons. This innovative approaches will be used to identify more of the genetic architecture of mental phenotypes, determine the functional implications of these gene variants, and develop prediction tools for treatment stratification in a personalized medicine framework.
