Chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs, often aided by search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to
find high-performing solutions. With argenomic we provide an novel algorithm that produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different molecules, illuminates the distribution of optimal solutions, and improves search efficiency compared to both machine learning and traditional genetic algorithm approaches.

Let's get started

Standing on the shoulders of giants

Like all valuable scientific work, the ideas behind argenomic were not born in a vaccuum.
