Chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs, often aided by search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to
find high-performing solutions. With argenomic we provide a novel type of algorithm that produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different molecules, illuminates the fitness of molecules over chemical space, and improves search efficiency compared to both machine learning and genetic algorithm approaches.

Shining a light on chemical space

The goal of a classical optimisation algorithm is to obtain the highest performing solution in a search space. If the exact mathematical form of the evaluation function is inaccessible, as is typically the case in molecular optimisation, heuristic search methods tend to become a necessity. Many of these heuristic methods are inspired by biological phenomena. Genetic algorithms are based on the theory of evolution and aim to optimise with regard to an evaluation function, incrementally improving on existing solutions. Specifically, novel solutions are generated by randomly changing or stochastically combining solutions from the existing population. In the genetic algorithm community, these two operations are respectively known as *mutations* and *crossovers*. Genetic algorithms can be highly effective in straightforward optimisation problems, but are known to struggle when trying to cross low-performing valleys or to break out of local optima, both of these occurrences can lead to evolutionary stagnation.

Argenomic evades evolutionary stagnation by enforcing molecular diversity. Moreover, Argenomic speeds up the optimisation process by decoupling mutations from crossovers, and introduces the concept of positional analogue scanning to genetic algorithms.

Handing over the reins

Standing on the shoulders of giants
------
As in all creative endeavors, the ideas behind argenomic were not born in a vaccuum. The projected was kickstarted by discovering the [multi-dimensional archive of phenotypic elites](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04909) (MAP-Elites) as devised by [Jean-Baptiste Mouret](https://members.loria.fr/JBMouret/) and [Jeff Clune](http://jeffclune.com/). MAP-Elites is a simple, efficacious and surprisingly powerful tool developed in the context of soft robot design, which solves stagnation issues in genetic algorithms by mimicing biological evolutionary diversity. In MAP-Elites, candidate solutions are generated by a genetic algorithm but are assigned to a niche -- in which only the single fittest candidate survives -- depending on user-defined characterising features. 

Armed with MAP-Elites we set out to build argenomic, and settled on a [graph-based genetic algorithm](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/SC/C8SC05372C#!divAbstract) as our underlying molecular optimisation tool. In a graph-based genetic algorithm, candiate molecules are represented by their molecular graph and *mutations* and *crossovers* are implemented as actions on the graph. Thanks to [Jan H. Jensen](https://chem.ku.dk/ansatte/alle/?pure=en/persons/300883) a fully [open-source implementation](https://github.com/jensengroup/GB-GA) was available. For our genetic algorithm implementation, we expanded his list of mutations and crossovers, and enhanced it with positional analogue scanning and an improved flow control. In-depth technical discussions can be found in our [accompanying paper](https://chemrxiv.org/). The [source code](https://github.com/Jonas-Verhellen/Argenomic) of argenomic can be found on github.
