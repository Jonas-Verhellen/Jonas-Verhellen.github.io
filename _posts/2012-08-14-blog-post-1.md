Chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs, often aided by search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to
find high-performing solutions. In the past few years, there has been considerable activity in both academic and industrial research to develop innovative deep learning approaches to perform this search through chemical space. These models aim to generate chemical compounds which exhibit desired behaviour, without reverting to explicit chemical rules, patterns or transformations. Instead, deep learning models learn from experimental data, and attempt to extrapolate the relevant aspects of the underlying chemistry. In terms of performance, deep learning models for molecular optimisation are however rivalled by more traditional, and significantly faster, rule-based approaches such as genetic algorithms.
