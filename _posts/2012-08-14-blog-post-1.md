Chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs, often aided by search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to
find high-performing solutions. With argenomic we provide an novel algorithm that produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different molecules, illuminates the distribution of optimal solutions, and improves search efficiency compared to both machine learning and genetic algorithm approaches.

Let's get started

Standing on the shoulders of giants

As in all creative endeavors, the ideas behind argenomic were not born in a vaccuum. The core architecture of our algorithm is based  on the the multi-dimensional archive of phenotypic elites algorithm (MAP-Elites). MAP-Elites is a simple, efficacious and surprisingly powerful tool developed in the context of soft robot design, and mimics diversity in biological evolution by introducing the concept of niches to genetic algorithms. Candidate solutions are generated by a genetic algorithm but are assigned to different niches depending on their characterising features.
