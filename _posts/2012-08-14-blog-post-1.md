Chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs, often aided by search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to
find high-performing solutions. With argenomic we provide a novel type of algorithm that produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different molecules, illuminates the distribution of optimal solutions, and improves search efficiency compared to both machine learning and genetic algorithm approaches.

Standing on the shoulders of giants

As in all creative endeavors, the ideas behind argenomic were not born in a vaccuum. The projected was kickstarted by discovering the [multi-dimensional archive of phenotypic elites](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04909) (MAP-Elites) as devised by [Jean-Baptiste Mouret](https://members.loria.fr/JBMouret/) and [Jeff Clune](http://jeffclune.com/). MAP-Elites is a simple, efficacious and surprisingly powerful tool developed in the context of soft robot design, which solves stagnation issues in genetic algorithms by mimicing biological evolutionary diversity. In MAP-Elites, candidate solutions are generated by a genetic algorithm but are assigned to a niche -- in which only the single fittest candidate survives -- depending on user-defined characterising features. 

Armed with MAP-Elites we set out to build a argenomic, and settled on a [graph-based genetic algorithm](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/SC/C8SC05372C#!divAbstract) as our underlying molecular optimisation tool. In a graph-based genetic algorithm, candiate molecules are represented by their molecular graph and *mutations* and *crossovers* are implemented as actions on the graph. Thanks to Jan H. Jensen a fully [open-source implementation](https://github.com/jensengroup/GB-GA) was available. For our genetic algorithm implementation, we expanded his list of mutations and crossovers, and enhanced it with positional analogue scanning and other improvements. In-depth technical comments can be found in our [accompanying paper](https://chemrxiv.org/). The [source code](https://github.com/Jonas-Verhellen/Argenomic) of argenomic can be found on github.
