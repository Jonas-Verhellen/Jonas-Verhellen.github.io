Chemists search through the space of molecules to discover new drugs, often aided by search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space to
find high-performing solutions. With argenomic we provide an novel algorithm that produces a large diversity of high-performing, yet qualitatively different molecules, illuminates the distribution of optimal solutions, and improves search efficiency compared to both machine learning and genetic algorithm approaches.

Let's get started

Standing on the shoulders of giants

As in all creative endeavors, the ideas behind argenomic were not born in a vaccuum. As conceptual basis for our optimissation algorithm, we looked at graph-based genetic algorithms for molecular optimisation. In a graph-based genetic algorithm, candiate molecules are represented by their molecular graph and *mutations* and *crossovers* are implemented as actions on the graph. This elegant graph-based approach has been shown to outporfm both deep learning methods and genetic algorithms based on a SMILES representation. Unfortunately genetic algortihms are sometimes marred by stagnation issues.

In argenomic we resolved stagnation by building the core architecture of our algorithm around the multi-dimensional archive of phenotypic elites algorithm (MAP-Elites). MAP-Elites is a simple, efficacious and surprisingly powerful tool developed in the context of soft robot design, and mimics diversity in biological evolution by introducing the concept of niches to genetic algorithms. Candidate solutions are generated by a genetic algorithm but are assigned to a niche, in which only the single fittest candidate survives, depending on user-defined characterising features.
